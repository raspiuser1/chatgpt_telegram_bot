# What does it do?
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning)[2] with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

it does the same thing as on their website https://beta.openai.com/ but in telegram, so you give your 
command and your answer will be in telegram.

# What do i need?
A computer with linus or a raspberry pi for example.
some librarys like:

`pip install telegram` 
`pip install openai` 

get your API key from chatgpt and put it in to ai_api.txt
