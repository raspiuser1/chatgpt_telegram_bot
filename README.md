# What does it do?
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language   models, and is fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning)[2] with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.  

it does the same thing as on their website https://beta.openai.com/ but with your own telegram bot, so you give your  
command in telegram and your answer will be in telegram.  

# What do i need?
A computer with linux or a raspberry pi for example.  
some librarys like:  

`pip install telegram`  
`pip install openai`  

you may need to change the rights of the file to read and execute.

get your API key from chatgpt, login and look in the settings for your key and put it in to ai_api.txt  
get your API key from the @botfather at telegram and put the key in key.txt see:
